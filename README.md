## Problem Description
Our team decided to look into the car dealership industry.  We chose this because we felt that there is problem in the lack of organization and management between sales, finance, and the service departments within a car dealership. Our team created Data Model to address this problem and showcase the relationships between all aspects of a car dealership. The Data Model comprises different entities that form the car dealership system as a whole, such as sales, payments, service requests, customers, salespeople, vehicles, etc. These entities are interconnected through appropriate relationships and possess detailed attributes within each category. The goal of our project is to make the car dealership process more smooth, facilitate communication between different departments, and improve customer satisfaction experience.

Improvements:
- Our first improvement is offering any service request at the car dealership at a reduced rate so the customer doesnt feel the need to find a 3rd party business. These service requests can include anything from car matienece to general detailing and cleaning. 
- Another improvement is the incorporation of a personalized salesperson. We have a head manager assuring each saleperson is doing their job well, and each customer will only ever have to deal with one salesperson. Dealing with one and only one trained professional will help reduce the customer stress and make them feel more comfortable in the experience.
